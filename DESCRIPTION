Description: This package provide functions that facilitate basic sensory and consumer data analysis such as characterization
  of products, panelists and sessions, Anova of factors effects,
  descriptive and multivariate analysis and Internal Preference 
  Mapping performing. It provides also EPM construction with many 
  options on dimension reduction and with several methods of linear
  and non linear regression models. It allows womparison of the 
  quality of models using several criteria and by introducing
  a new measure counting the number of predictions outside the 
  liking scores space. This package helps drawing a  smoothed  
  version of EPM by using local regressions to make smooth the 
  curves of levels in the heat map. A computational method was implemented
  as a tool to measure the quality of the stability of EPM. 
  The shiny application provides GUI for the functionalities.
